# BeaconAI Enhanced Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

BeaconAI introduces a novel method of offline identity verification and discovery using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and TinyML. The system enables users to create cryptographically signed identity tokens that combine biometric and semantic data, allowing for trusted peer interactions without internet connectivity.

## 🧬 Core Concept

BeaconAI addresses the fundamental challenge of identity verification in offline, proximity-based networking scenarios. By encoding user identities into compact, verifiable tokens, the system enables:

- **Offline-first identity verification** using cryptographic signatures
- **Privacy-preserving peer discovery** via Bluetooth advertising
- **On-device verification** using TinyML models
- **Time-bound, revocable credentials** for enhanced security

## Key Innovation

The system's unique approach combines:
1. **Biometric encoding** (selfie/fingerprint → vector representation)
2. **Semantic embedding** (name, role, organization → vector representation)  
3. **Cryptographic signing** (Ed25519/ECDSA signatures)
4. **BLE-based distribution** (proximity networking)
5. **On-device verification** (TinyML inference)

## Target Use Cases

| Context | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 💼 Professional Networking | Secure identity sharing at offline events |
| 🤝 Community Events | Anonymous yet verifiable presence |
| 🆔 Portable ID Verification | Mobile identity in poor connectivity areas |
| 🌐 Pop-up Networks | Temporary access control and group formation |
| 📜 Offline Credentials | Portable certificates and endorsements |

## Technical Differentiators

- **No network dependency** - Trust verified cryptographically
- **TinyML-powered validation** - No cloud inference required
- **Privacy-first discovery** - Zero-knowledge identity handshakes
- **Revocable tokens** - Time-bound credentials prevent long-term exposure

## Technology Stack Overview

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|-------------|
| **Embeddings** | FaceNet, MobileNetV2, TinyBERT, DistilBERT |
| **Cryptography** | Ed25519, PyNaCl, JOSE |
| **On-device ML** | TensorFlow Lite, MediaPipe, CoreML |
| **BLE** | react-native-ble-plx, custom GATT services |
| **Storage** | Encrypted SQLite, SecureStore, MMKV |

## Success Metrics

- Token verification accuracy (>95%)
- Discovery latency (<3 seconds)
- Battery impact (<5% additional drain)
- User adoption in target scenarios
- Security audit compliance
